Basic Info Regarding Each Script:

light.sh AND fan.sh are scripts to control the fan in my room via curl by sending GET requests to my Arduino connected to my router.

monitor_off.sh does exactly what is says - turns off my laptop monitor via a keyboard shortcut. (Shortcut not provided)

youtube.sh is basically my version of a youtube video downloader from the command line.
